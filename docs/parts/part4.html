        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>5 minutes</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            In this demonstration, we will look at both the server-side implementation which adds filters to the queries issued by the client, as well as some minor changes to the client to hit the right endpoint.
        </p>

        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>
            There is a completed version of the client in the <b>Exercise 4</b> folder. In addition, the <b>Server</b> folder included with these materials has a complete copy of the service we are calling.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
        You can explore the completed project on your own, here are the relevant changes made to the application to support refresh tokens - compare it to the prior exercise's Completed solution to get a full delta.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The table endpoint was changed from <b>tables/diaryentry2</b> to <b>tables/diaryentry3</b> to get the support from the live system for query filtering on the server side.</li>
            <li>We've added a new <b>UserId</b> field to the DTO in <b>DiaryEntry.cs</b>.</li>
            <li>We need to call <code>PurgeAsync</code> at least once to clear the offline cache since we are now returning fewer records.</li>
        </ol>
